                      Of course. Most bee jobs are
                      small ones. But bees know
                      
                        
                      that every small job,
                      if it's done well, means a lot.
                      
                        
                      But choose carefully
                      
                        
                      because you'll stay in the job
                      you pick for the rest of your life.

              <h5>HARD PIVOT TO QUANTUM PHYSICS</h5>
              <p>Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles.[2]:1.1 It is the foundation of all quantum physics including quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.

              Classical physics, the description of physics that existed before the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, describes many aspects of nature at an ordinary (macroscopic) scale, while quantum mechanics explains the aspects of nature at small (atomic and subatomic) scales, for which classical mechanics is insufficient. Most theories in classical physics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid at large (macroscopic) scale.[3]
                
              Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum, angular momentum, and other quantities of a bound system are restricted to discrete values (quantization), objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave-particle duality), and there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (the uncertainty principle.</p>
              <h5>BACK TO OUR LORD AND SAVIOR</h5>
              <p>
              Truly, the greatest symbol of new life is found in an empty tomb!

              Romans 8:11 "But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who dwells in you."

              You know I love suprises, I love them because you never know what to expect, and with suprises come imagination, and the Imagination is a Wonderful thing... Out of it we get –

              A FAIRY that leaves money under a pillow for Teeth... A FAT Man in a red suit w/ a long white beard that delivers gifts... A RABBIT that lays colorful Eggs with sweet goodies in them ... but all of this it’s all empty celebration.

              I promise You don’t need a bunny or some colorful eggs to excite my imagination about Easter. Easter stands alone on it’s own w/out any help! Our empty celebration is found in the empty tomb! Easter is not a special occassion - it's a way of life!

              This morning I want preach on this subject "A Tomb With A View!"
