                  <h5>HERE IT GOES..</h5>
      
                  <p>According to all known laws
                    of aviation,
                    
                      
                    there is no way a bee
                    should be able to fly.
                    
                      
                    Its wings are too small to get
                    its fat little body off the ground.
                    
                      
                    The bee, of course, flies anyway
                    
                      
                    because bees don't care
                    what humans think is impossible.
                    
                      
                    Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
                    Yellow, black. Yellow, black.
                    
                      
                    Ooh, black and yellow!
                    Let's shake it up a little.
                    
                      
                    Barry! Breakfast is ready!
                    
                      
                    Ooming!
                    
                      
                    Hang on a second.
                    
                      
                    Hello?
                    
                      
                    - Barry?
                    - Adam?
                    
                      
                    - Oan you believe this is happening?
                    - I can't. I'll pick you up.
                    
                      
                    Looking sharp.
                    
                      
                    Use the stairs. Your father
                    paid good money for those.
                    
                      
                    Sorry. I'm excited.
                    
                      
                    Here's the graduate.
                    We're very proud of you, son.
                    
                      
                    A perfect report card, all B's.
                    
                      
                    Very proud.
                    
                      
                    Ma! I got a thing going here.
                    
                      
                    - You got lint on your fuzz.
                    - Ow! That's me!
                    
                      
                    - Wave to us! We'll be in row 118,000.
                    - Bye!
                    
                      
                    Barry, I told you,
                    stop flying in the house!
                    
                      
                    - Hey, Adam.
                    - Hey, Barry.
                    
                      
                    - Is that fuzz gel?
                    - A little. Special day, graduation.
                    
                      
                    Never thought I'd make it.
                    
                      
                    Three days grade school,
                    three days high school.
                    
                      
                    Those were awkward.
                    
                      
                    Three days college. I'm glad I took
                    a day and hitchhiked around the hive.
                    
                      
                    You did come back different.
                    
                      
                    - Hi, Barry.
                    - Artie, growing a mustache? Looks good.
                    
                      
                    - Hear about Frankie?
                    - Yeah.
                    
                      
                    - You going to the funeral?
                    - No, I'm not going.
      
                    
                  </p>

                    Honey!
                    
                      
                    - That girl was hot.
                    - She's my cousin!
                    
                      
                    - She is?
                    - Yes, we're all cousins.
                    
                      
                    - Right. You're right.
                    - At Honex, we constantly strive
                    
                      
                    to improve every aspect
                    of bee existence.
                    
                      
                    These bees are stress-testing
                    a new helmet technology.
                    
                      
                    - What do you think he makes?
                    - Not enough.
                    
                      
                    Here we have our latest advancement,
                    the Krelman.
                    
                      
                    - What does that do?
                    - Oatches that little strand of honey
                    
                      
                    that hangs after you pour it.
                    Saves us millions.
                    
                      
                    Oan anyone work on the Krelman?
                    
                      
                    Of course. Most bee jobs are
                    small ones. But bees know
                    
                      
                    that every small job,
                    if it's done well, means a lot.
                    
                      
                    But choose carefully
                    
                      
                    because you'll stay in the job
                    you pick for the rest of your life.
                    
                      
                    The same job the rest of your life?
                    I didn't know that.
                    
                      
                    What's the difference?
                    
                      
                    You'll be happy to know that bees,
                    as a species, haven't had one day off
                    
                      
                    in 27 million years.
                    
                      
                    So you'll just work us to death?
                    
                      
                    We'll sure try.
                    
                      
                    Wow! That blew my mind!
                    
                      
                    "What's the difference?"
                    How can you say that?
                    
                      
                    One job forever?
                    That's an insane choice to have to make.
                    
                      
                    I'm relieved. Now we only have
                    to make one decision in life.
                    
                      
                    But, Adam, how could they
                    never have told us that?
                    
                      
                    Why would you question anything?
                    We're bees.
                    
                      
                    We're the most perfectly
                    functioning society on Earth.
                    
                      
                    You ever think maybe things
                    work a little too well here?
                    
                      
                    Like what? Give me one example.
                    
                      
                    I don't know. But you know
                    what I'm talking about.

                    A bee died. Makes an opening. See?
                    He's dead. Another dead one.

                        Of course. Most bee jobs are
                        small ones. But bees know
                        
                          
                        that every small job,
                        if it's done well, means a lot.
                        
                          
                        But choose carefully
                        
                          
                        because you'll stay in the job
                        you pick for the rest of your life.
